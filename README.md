## Overview
This project is an Online Learning Management System (LMS) built using WordPress, aimed at making online education easier for both students and instructors. As a junior web developer, I developed this fully responsive platform to simplify course creation, student enrollments, quizzes, and payments. Itâ€™s designed to create a smooth experience for everyone involved in the learning process.
